# ML Models

## I implemented some models on my own after learning Machine Learning.

### currently Implemented Models:
* Linear Regression (using only numpy,pandas and pyplot)
* Linear Regression with Quadratic Features (using only numpy,pandas and pyplot)
* Neural Network (using only numpy,pandas and pyplot) (only 1 hidden layer with 6 neurons, having 6x6x1 layer)
